## Sharing presentations

- enter presentation folder
- type `present -c` - present.tar.gz will be created
- send file
  - user can start presentation with `present -f present.tar.gz`
  - user can unpack file, enter folder and execute `present`

## Browser paths

when presentation is opened in browser few paths exists:
- `/` -> show presentation in selected aspect ratio
- `/print` -> presentation without forced aspect ratio (use for printing)
- `/login` -> path to log in admin credentials
- `/stats` -> path to log in admin credentials

## Customizations & security

- present will watch for three files:
  - `present.env` in active directory (this will not override already existing ENV values)
  - `.env` in active directory (this **will** override already existing ENV values)
  - `present.env` in user HOME directory (this **will** override already existing ENV values)
- `.env` file or corresponding variables can be used to customize behavior
  ```txt
  ADMIN_PWD=AdminPassword123
  USER_PWD=user
  PORT=8080
  NEXT_PAGE=ArrowRight,ArrowDown,PageDown,Space,e
  PREVIOUS_PAGE=ArrowLeft,ArrowUp,PageUp
  TERMINAL_CAST=r,b
  TERMINAL_CLOSE=c
  MENU=m
  ```
- if `ADMIN_PWD` is set, only users authorized with that password can execute the code
  - if `ADMIN_PWD` is not provided, it will be generated and written on console
    - with `ADMIN_PWD_DISABLE=true` you can remove need for admin password
  - admin password can be entered on `/login` url (for example http://localhost:8080/login)
- if `USER_PWD` is set, all 'users' will need to enter password to see the presentation
- rest are pretty self explanatory (also in examples are defaults for all options)
